# 3D Portfolio Website Project
### React.js + Vite + Tailwind Css + Three.js

## Technologies Used
I used the following technologies to build this project:

### React.js
React is a popular JavaScript library used for creating user interfaces. In our project, we opted for React to build a component-based structure and manage data dynamically.

### Three.js
Three.js is a JavaScript library used for creating 3D graphics and animations. This library allowed us to visualize our projects in 3D space and provide users with a captivating 3D experience.

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS enables the use of customizable CSS components quickly and flexibly. We chose Tailwind CSS to design our website's layout.

### Vite
Vite provides a fast and modern development environment. We used Vite to quickly start and develop our project.
